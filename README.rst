agile-py
========

A command line tool for managing lists and tasks in an agile format. 

Agile is a methodology for workflow and task management. It has `12 principles <http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html>`_ and is used in some form by many organizations. Tools, such as `Trello <https://trello.com/>`_ can be use for agile, but they are purely browser based. 

The purpose of this tool is to allow agile tools to be used within a command line interface. This would allow for automated tasks to finish with the automated movement of tasks from one column to another.
